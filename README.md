# ibuildrun

Full-stack developer portfolio. I build web apps, backends, desktop software, and Telegram bots.

**Live:** [ibuildrun.ru](https://ibuildrun.ru) | [ibuildrun.github.io/ibuildrun](https://ibuildrun.github.io/ibuildrun)

## Stack

- **Web:** Next.js, React, Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core, Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL
- **Desktop:** WPF, .NET 8
- **Bots:** Telegram Bot API, aiogram, Telegraf
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions

## Approach

My workflow is AI-augmented. Kiro, Cursor, Claude — I use them daily. Not as a crutch, but as leverage. They handle the repetitive stuff, I focus on architecture and solving actual problems.

Write less boilerplate, ship more features.
