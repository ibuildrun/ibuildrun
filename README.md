# ibuildrun

Full-stack developer. I build web apps, backends, desktop software, and Telegram bots.

Stack doesn't matter much — it's just a tool. What matters is shipping working software.
I pick whatever fits the problem: Next.js or Angular for frontend, .NET or Node for backend, 
WPF for desktop.

My workflow is AI-augmented. Kiro, Cursor, Claude — I use them daily. 
Not as a crutch, but as leverage. They handle the repetitive stuff, 
I focus on architecture and solving actual problems.

### Stack

**Web:** Next.js, React, Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** ASP.NET Core, Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL  
**Desktop:** WPF, .NET 8  
**Bots:** Telegram Bot API, aiogram, Telegraf  
**DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD

### Approach

Write less boilerplate, ship more features. 
AI tools let me move faster without cutting corners on quality.
